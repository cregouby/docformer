# docformer

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

{docformer} is an implementation of [DocFormer: End-to-End Transformer
for Document Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11539) relying on
[torch for R](https://torch.mlverse.org/resources/) providing a
multi-modal transformer based architecture for the task of Visual
Document Understanding (VDU) ðŸ“„ðŸ“„ðŸ“„, as a port of
[shabie/docformer](https://github.com/shabie/docformer) code.

DocFormer uses text, vision and spatial features and combines them using
a novel multi-modal self-attention layer. DocFormer can be pre-trained
in an unsupervised fashion using carefully designed tasks which
encourage multi-modal interaction. DocFormer also shares learned spatial
embeddings across modalities which makes it easy for the model to
correlate text to visual tokens and vice versa. DocFormer is evaluated
on 4 different datasets each with strong baselines. DocFormer achieves
state-of-the-art results on all of them, sometimes beating models 4x
larger in no. of parameters. ![High-level

## Installation

You can install the development version of docformer like so:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("cregouby/docformer")
#> Downloading GitHub repo cregouby/docformer@HEAD
#> glue (1.6.0 -> 1.6.1) [CRAN]
#> cli  (3.1.0 -> 3.1.1) [CRAN]
#> Installing 2 packages: glue, cli
#> Installation des packages dans '/home/home/creg/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.1'
#> (car 'lib' n'est pas spÃ©cifiÃ©)
#> * checking for file â€˜/tmp/RtmpgDSW8k/remotes5bc885f487e2a/cregouby-docformer-58b3f1c/DESCRIPTIONâ€™ ... OK
#> * preparing â€˜docformerâ€™:
#> * checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... OK
#> * checking for LF line-endings in source and make files and shell scripts
#> * checking for empty or unneeded directories
#> * building â€˜docformer_0.1.0.tar.gzâ€™
#> Installation du package dans '/home/home/creg/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.1'
#> (car 'lib' n'est pas spÃ©cifiÃ©)
```

docformer relies on the `{sentencepiece}` package for tokenization
prerequisites

``` r
remotes::install_github("bnosac/sentencepiece")
#> Skipping install of 'sentencepiece' from a github remote, the SHA1 (712f7235) has not changed since last install.
#>   Use `force = TRUE` to force installation
```

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
